Other,Festival,UAE,Eid-Ul-Fitr,India,Moharram,Yes,1,"Eid al-Fitr is the earlier of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Adha). Eid al-Fitr is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan. Eid al-Fitr falls on the first day of Shawwal in the Islamic calendar; this does not always fall on the same Gregorian day, as the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by local religious authorities. ","Moharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar and is significant within Islam, particularly for Shia Muslims, as it marks the mourning period of Muharram. The tenth day of Moharram is known as Ashura, and it is a day of fasting for all Muslims, commemorating the day when Moses and his followers were saved from Pharaoh by God. However, for Shia Muslims, Ashura is also a day of mourning, remembering the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, at the Battle of Karbala.

Unlike Eid al-Fitr, Moharram is not considered a holiday or celebration but a solemn period of introspection, prayers, and mourning. While Eid al-Fitr is celebrated worldwide following the end of Ramadan, Moharram is observed according to the Islamic lunar calendar, and its observances vary across different countries and communities, including India, where both Sunni and Shia Muslims live.

In summary, Moharram and Eid al-Fitr serve different purposes within Islam and have distinct observances.
