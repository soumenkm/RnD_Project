It marks the beginning of the new year for both Sikhs and Hindus, including the Sindhi community who celebrate it as Cheti Chand. The festival holds special significance for Sikhs as it commemorates the formation of the Sikh Khalsa in 1699. Vaisakhi is also celebrated by Hindu communities, including the Indian and Nepalese diaspora in the United States, and the Bengali Hindu community who observe their new year 'Pohela Baisakh' on this day."
