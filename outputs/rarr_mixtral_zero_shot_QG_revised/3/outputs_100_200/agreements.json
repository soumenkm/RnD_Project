        "evidence": "The Dobos torta is still popular in Hungary today \u2014and also in Austria and other countries which were part of the Empire\u2014but is not usually prepared at home because it is so labor-intensive (and really easy to buy a beautifully-prepared whole cake). The Dobos torta (which is often written phonetically as Dobosh torte outside of Hungary) has also inspired layered cakes as far away as America. In New Orleans the Doberge cake is a layered cake usually filled with chocolate and lemon pudding and covered in butter cream or fondant. In Hawaii the popular Dobash cake is a chocolate chiffon cake with a chocolate pudding or Chantilly cream filling.",
