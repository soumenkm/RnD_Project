        "prompt": "I will fix some things you said.\n\n1. You said: Your nose switches back and forth between nostrils. When you sleep, you switch about every 45 minutes. This is to prevent a buildup of mucus. It\u2019s called the nasal cycle.\n2. I checked: How often do your nostrils switch?\n3. I found this article: Although we don\u2019t usually notice it, during the nasal cycle one nostril becomes congested and thus contributes less to airflow, while the other becomes decongested. On average, the congestion pattern switches about every 2 hours, according to a small 2016 study published in the journal PLOS One.\n4. This suggests 45 minutes switch time in your statement is wrong.\n5. My fix: Your nose switches back and forth between nostrils. When you sleep, you switch about every 2 hours. This is to prevent a buildup of mucus. It\u2019s called the nasal cycle.\n\n1. You said: In the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British side was led by General Thomas Hall.\n2.

You said: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm for converting the adjacency matrix of a graph into its adjacency list. It is named after Vaclav Havel and Samih Hakimi.\n2. I checked: What is the Havel-Hakimi algorithm?\n3. I found this article: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was published by Havel (1955), and later by Hakimi (1962).\n4. This suggests the Havel-Hakimi algorithm\u2019s functionality in your statement is wrong.\n5. My fix: The Havel-Hakimi algorithm constructs a special solution if a simple graph for the given degree sequence exists, or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. It is named after Vaclav Havel and Samih Hakimi.\n\n1. You said: \"Time of My Life\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bill Medley from the soundtrack of the 1987 film Dirty Dancing.

I found this article: Phoenix Market City was opened in January 2013 and has the distinction of being the largest mall in the city of Pune, with the area of 3.4 million square feet. It is located in the Viman Nagar area of Pune.\n4. This suggests the 1.4 million square feet of built-up space in your statment is wrong.\n5.
