[1] The layered pastry is named after its inventor, Hungarian chef J\u00f3zsef C. Dobos, a delicatessen owner in Budapest . [2] In the late 1800s, he decided to create a cake that would last longer than other pastries in an age when cooling techniques were limited. The round sides of the cake are coated with ground hazelnuts , chestnuts , walnuts , or almonds , and the hardened caramel top helps to prevent drying out, for a longer shelf life.",
