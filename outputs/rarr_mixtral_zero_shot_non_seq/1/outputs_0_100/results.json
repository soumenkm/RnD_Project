However, unlike the traditional understanding, many IMFLs are not made from grains but instead use a neutral spirit distilled from molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry. This is a common characteristic of IMFL production in India, distinguishing it from spirits produced elsewhere. The term \"IMFL\" is generally used to refer to all liquor produced in India, other than indigenous alcoholic beverages and spirits brought in bulk quantities from foreign countries and bottled in an excise-bonded warehouse."
