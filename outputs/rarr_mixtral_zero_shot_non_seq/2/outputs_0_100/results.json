        "claim_attributed": "Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), also known as country liquor, is a type of liquor produced in India using traditional methods such as fermenting grain mash, particularly for varieties like whiskey. However, many IMFLs are made with a neutral spirit derived from molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry. These spirits are not to be confused with indigenous alcoholic beverages like feni, toddy, arrack, and others. Despite the name \"Indian-made foreign liquor,\" they are not imported but rather manufactured in India. The term IMFL is used to distinguish all liquor produced in the country from indigenous alcoholic beverages."
