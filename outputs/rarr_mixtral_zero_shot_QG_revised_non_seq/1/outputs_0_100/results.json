IMFL is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically made of charred white oak or sometimes local woods like teak.",
        "claim_attributed": "Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) refers to a category of alcoholic beverages produced in India that emulate the styles and flavors of foreign liquors. They are manufactured domestically using locally sourced ingredients and techniques to create a similar taste profile to their foreign counterparts. Traditionally, IMFLs like whiskey are produced using fermented grain mash, particularly with grains such as jowar, bajra, maize, or rice. However, many IMFLs are distinctly characterized by the use of a neutral spirit distilled from molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry, which serves as the starting ingredient regardless of the final product. The aging process for IMFL typically involves wooden casks, often made of charred white oak or local woods like teak.\n\nThis attributed claim combines the main entity of the initial claim (Indian-made foreign liquor) with relevant evidence detailing its production process and characteristics while disregarding irrelevant information regarding Bottled in India (BII), other types of Indian alcoholic beverages, and historical references to IMFL's term usage."
