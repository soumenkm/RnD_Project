The novel tells the struggles caused by the French Revolution and the dangers that come with blanket persecutions of people for their connections rather than for their deeds. Although the protagonist and main character Charles Darnay is connected to the French aristocracy by blood, he has renounced all connection to the family and sympathizes with the oppressed citizens of France. However, some revolutionaries are unable to see past his lineage and he is doomed to suffer for the crimes of his ancestors despite his life\u2019s actions.",

The poem was composed in a grass hut in Champahatti, Navadwipa, north of what is now Kolkata, after Jayadeva turned his back on the sumptuous surroundings of the Bengal court. Among the most famous of Sanskrit texts, the Gita Govinda was translated into English by Sir William Jones and published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society , Calcutta in 1792.",
