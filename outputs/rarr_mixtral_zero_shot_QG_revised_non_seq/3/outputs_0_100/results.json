The mission consists of an Orbiter that will go around the Moon for a year in an orbit of 100 km from the surface, and a Lander with a Rover that was expected to land on the lunar surface and operate for one month. The Chandrayaan-2 mission is a follow-up to India's successful Chandrayaan-1 mission, which assisted in confirming the presence of water/hydroxyl on the moon in 2009. The landing attempt of the Vikram lander took place on September 6, 2019 (September 7 IST), when ISRO officials lost contact with the probe as it was just 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) above the lunar surface."
