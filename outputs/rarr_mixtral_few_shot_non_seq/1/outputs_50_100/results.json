IMFL, a term for non-native alcoholic beverages like whisky, is usually produced using conventional techniques like fermenting grain mash or a neutral spirit derived from molasses, a sugar industry byproduct. These offer a wide range of flavors and are produced through sourcing ingredients, fermentation, distillation, ageing, blending, and bottling. Country liquor, due to its cheap price, is popular among impoverished people and is traditionally fermented and distilled from molasses."
