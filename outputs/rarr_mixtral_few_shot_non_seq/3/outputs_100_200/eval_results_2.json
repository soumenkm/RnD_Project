Although INSAT-1A, the initial satellite, could not fulfill its mission, INSAT-1B, launched in August 1983, initiated a revolution in India's television and radio broadcasting, telecommunications, and meteorological sectors. The system allowed for rapid expansion of TV and modern telecommunication facilities to remote areas and off-shore islands, providing transponders in C, Extended C, and K u bands for various communication services. ISRO, India's primary space agency, had previously launched experimental satellites like Aryabhata in 1975 for research purposes, completely designed and manufactured in India. The INSAT-1 series of satellites were launched from the United States.",
