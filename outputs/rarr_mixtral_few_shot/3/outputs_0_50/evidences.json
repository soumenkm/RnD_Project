Flight 101 was scheduled to fly from Bombay to London, stopping at Delhi, Beirut and Geneva. The subsequent investigation found that the pilots mistakenly thought they had passed the Mont Blanc ridge and began descending in accordance with the ATC instruction. The miscalculation of the aircraft position was attributed to one of the VOR receivers on board being unserviceable and giving an unreliable position fix of the aircraft.",
