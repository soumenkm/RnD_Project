        "query": "India: Which spice is used to flavor the sweetened, thickened milk in which the cottage cheese balls are soaked in Rasmalai?",
        "evidence": "This term, Rasmalai, is a conjunction of two words, \u2018 ras \u2019 meaning juice or syrup and \u2018 malai \u2019 meaning cream. This mouth-watering dessert, made from chenna (homemade paneer or cottage cheese), is decadent in flavors and textures. The chenna, prepared from full-fat milk, is kneaded until smooth and divided into small balls or disc-shaped rasmalais. These balls/ discs (patties) are then boiled in the sugar syrup for sweetness and soaked in thickened saffron and cardamom-saffron-flavored milk.",
